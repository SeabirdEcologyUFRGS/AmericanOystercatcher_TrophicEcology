# AmericanOystercatcher_TrophicEcology

This repository refers to the study developed to test spatiotemporal differences in the diet of American Oystercatchers (Haematopus palliatus) in southern Brazil. The study evidenced that oystercatchers, although Bivalvia specialists, have a certain trophic plasticity according to the prey available around the breeding sites.

The study was the subject of the MSc La√≠s Gliesch da Silva Master's thesis and the full text can be accessed here https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fooweb.2023.e00300
